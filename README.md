# OrbitNerd Scripts

The scripts contained within this repository are copies of what was previously
posted on the OrbitNerd.com website. I setup this repo since that website is
now defunct.

What's contained herein are my implementations of algorithms that can be found
in standard texts such as *Orbital Mechanics* by Prussing and Conway or
*Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications* by Vallado.

This code was written to work within Matlab or Octave (the freeware version of
Matlab). I do not have plans to convert this code into Python, though there are
likely existing Python packages which already have similar implementations.
